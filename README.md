# Spiral_Snakes
It's a simple three-round snake game using the pygame module of python with an increasing number of obstacles and complexity of the game. I must say you shall give it a try once as I'm sure if you play it once you can't get out of it. Though a simple very common game is still interesting with some tricks and twists inside. Happy playing geeks!
